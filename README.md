# InkTrack

InkTrack allows tattoo artists (or other small business owners) to manage many of the important, but time consuming, aspects of working with individual clients. The primary functions are:
- Document creation, filling, and organization
- Maintain client notes
- Scheduling and Appointment Reminders

## Documents:

Document management can be a big challenge for tattoo artists. Different locations require varied information, with some locations requiring nearly nothing, and others requiring dozens of pieces of identifying information. InkTrack provides the following capabilities to assist with that:
- Pre-built forms that cover the bases for most locations
- The ability to create your own forms with 40+ different input types
- Completed document storage through InkTrack

## Client Notes:

Every client is different, and an artist can easily have more than 100 regulars. Keeping track of each of their plans, preferences, references, and anything else you might want to know, can be overwhelming. InkTrack offers the client management tool to do the following:
- Keep client contact information
- Write notes on each client
- Store reference images for client tattoos

## Scheduling:

Keeping your schedule organized shouldn't be hard. InkTrack allows you to make scheduling as easy as possible with its scheduling tool:
- Block off times that you will and won't work
- Allow the client to schedule based on your times OR manage the scheduling yourself entirely
- Set up automatic appointment reminders so your clients never miss an appointment again
